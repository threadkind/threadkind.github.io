        <p>Hi! I'm Amy. I'm a self-taught front end web developer. I currently code primarily in HTML, CSS, Javascript and React, although I do have experience in other areas such as JQuery and Ruby on Rails. I enjoying learning new techniques, frameworks and languages through online courses, watching conference talks and tutorials online, listening to podcasts and engaging in the online coding community. I also have a lot of experience in design programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Gimp, Inkscape etc. I enjoy designing and creating mobile responsive websites and progressive web apps.
        I recently completed the Grow with Google Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree which I got a scholarship for earlier this year.
        I have also completed (and continue to work through) many other courses on Udacity, FreeCodeCamp and Coursera. I enjoy both the problem solving, logical and the creative side of coding.
        I also enjoy using code to solve every day issues (see the TV Spinner and Bedtime Game in the <a href="#work">work section</a> of my portfolio!).
